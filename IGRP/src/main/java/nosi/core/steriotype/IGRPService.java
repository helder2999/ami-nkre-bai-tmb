/**
 * Indicates that an annotated class is a "Service", originally defined by Domain-Driven
 * Design (Evans, 2003) as "an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the
 * model, with no encapsulated state."
 *
 * <p>May also indicate that a class is a "Business Service Facade" (in the Core J2EE
 * patterns sense), or something similar. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype
 * and individual teams may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate.
 *
 * <p>This annotation serves as a specialization of {@link Component @IGRPComponent},
 * allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.
